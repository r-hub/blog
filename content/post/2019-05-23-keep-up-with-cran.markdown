CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, changes its rules and workflow every so often: see for instance [the new encoding setting of one of its check flavors](/2019/04/25/r-devel-linux-x86-64-debian-clang/). As a package developer, you'd better keep up with CRAN policies and processes to be able to safely retain your package(s) on CRAN and to prepare your next submissions with as much information as possible. We at R-hub are also every interested in not missing updates, in particular of the check setups, in order for our services to serve package developers as well as possible. In this post, we'll therefore answer this important question: **How** to keep up with CRAN policies and processes?
