```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      cache = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE)
```


Earlier this year when launching this blog we [explained why R package developers should care about R-hub](/2019/03/26/why-care/). So, does anyone care? :wink: Yes! Let's summarize R-hub usage.

## Usage data

As specified in our [use terms](https://builder.r-hub.io/terms.html) we do not store user data. However we do store some usage data. In the table loaded below, emails and packages are unidentified -- but you can know whether an email or package comes up several times. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
my_not_portable_path <- "/home/maelle/Documents/R-hub/rhub-usage/rhub-builds.rds"
```

```{r}
builds <- tibble::as_tibble(readRDS(my_not_portable_path))
builds
```

## A recent increase in usage

### Towards 1,000 builds a week? 

```{r usage-week, fig.cap="Weekly count of builds on R-hub package builder, showing an slow increase until mid 2018 then a steeper increase to a little less than 1,000 builds a week"}
library("ggplot2")
library("magrittr")
dplyr::mutate(builds, 
             week = as.Date(cut(submitted, "week"))) %>%
  dplyr::count(week) %>%
ggplot(aes(week, n)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ylab("No. of buids") +
  xlab("Time (weeks)") +
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum(base_size = 16,
                          axis_title_size = 16)
```

When plotting the weekly count of builds as below, it is quite clear that usage stepped up at the end of last year. A delayed effect of the [RStudio webinar about R-hub](https://resources.rstudio.com/the-essentials-of-data-science/r-hub-overview-ga-bor-csa-rdi)?

### Number of unique packages built per week

```{r usage-week-pkg, fig.cap="Weekly count of builds on R-hub package builder, showing an increase, then a stagnation in 2018, then a steeper increase since the end of 2018, to about 125 packages a week. Some weeks have a surprising high number of packages built."}
dplyr::mutate(builds, 
             week = as.Date(cut(submitted, "week"))) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(week) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(n = length(unique(package))) %>%
ggplot(aes(week, n)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylab("No. of packages built") +
  xlab("Time (weeks)")  +
  geom_smooth() +
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum(base_size = 16,
                          axis_title_size = 16)
```

The number of unique packages built mostly follow the number of builds apart from a stagnation last year.

### Number of unique users per week

What about the number of users?

```{r usage-week-user, fig.cap="Weekly count of builds on R-hub package builder, showing an slow increase until mid 2018 then a steeper increase to a bit more than 100 users a week"}
dplyr::mutate(builds, 
             week = as.Date(cut(submitted, "week"))) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(week) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(n = length(unique(email))) %>%
ggplot(aes(week, n)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ylab("No. of distinct email addresses") +
  xlab("Time (weeks)") +
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum(base_size = 16,
                          axis_title_size = 16)
```

So all in all, the R-hub package builder is serving more and more users and packages.

## Platform usage

Choosing a platform or platforms for your package check might seem daunting. Luckily we've written up [some guidance in our docs](https://docs.r-hub.io/#which-platform)!

### Most frequently used platforms

```{r}
builds %>%
  dplyr::count(platform, sort = TRUE) %>%
  head(n = 7) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

The most frequently used platforms reflect the default platforms (ubuntu-gcc-release for the web interface), including the default platforms mix for [`rhub::check_for_cran()`](https://r-hub.github.io/rhub/reference/check_for_cran.html) (windows-x86_64-devel, ubuntu-gcc-release, fedora-clang-devel and if the package needs compilation linux-x86_64-rocker-gcc-san).

### Newest platforms

What platforms were added to the pool this year?

```{r}
builds %>%
  dplyr::group_by(platform) %>%
  dplyr::filter(lubridate::year(as.Date(min(submitted))) == 2019) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(first = as.Date(min(submitted))) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

The youngest platforms are [r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-clang and its special encoding](/2019/04/25/r-devel-linux-x86-64-debian-clang/), [a noLD platform](/2019/05/21/nold/), [the experimental Windows Rtools4.0 platform](https://twitter.com/rhub_/status/1102510360337268737). 

## Web interface or R package?

Although R-hub package builder has a working web interface, we [recommend using the `rhub` package for submitting builds](https://docs.r-hub.io/#pkg-vs-web). Since March this year, for builds we record whether they were submitted via the web interface or the package.

```{r}
(ui <- table(builds$ui))
```

So, `r round(ui[1]/(sum(ui)), digits = 3)*100`% of builds were submitted via the [`rhub` package](https://r-hub.github.io/rhub/). Great!

## Conclusion

In this post we presented a few figures underlining the growth in R-hub usage, and the variety of platforms used for checking packages -- one of [R-hub's selling points](https://deploy-preview-53--admiring-allen-9a00b2.netlify.com/2019/03/26/why-care/#so-many-platforms). In total, over time, the R-hub package builder has been used by `r length(unique(builds$email))` users for `r length(unique(builds$package))` packages. For comparison at the time of writing there are `r nrow(available.packages())` packages on CRAN. 

We hope to keep helping package developers check their packages and debug issues, in particular thanks to the package builder, [its docs](https://docs.r-hub.io/), and this blog. Thanks to all users who notified problems and suggested enhancements via [GitHub](https://docs.r-hub.io/#pkg-dev-help) or [gitter](https://gitter.im/r-hub/community), keep your feedback and questions coming!
