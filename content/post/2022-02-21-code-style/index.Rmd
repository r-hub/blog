Do you indent your code with [one tab, two spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI), or eight spaces?
Do you feel strongly about the location of the curly brace closing a function definition?
Do you have naming preferences?
You probably have picked up some habits along the way.
In any case, having some sort of consistency in coding style will help those who read the code to understand, fix or enhance it.
In this post, we shall share some resources about coding style, useful tools, and some remarks on etiquette.

## What *is* coding style?

Coding style is a set of rules about well, aesthetics (aligning and code spacing) but also naming (of variables, functions, etc.), commenting, structuring (e.g. avoiding complex logic), etc.
Despite coding style having an universal goal: making it easy to understand, there is no right coding style as the "correct" choice depends on personal preferences, and the [constraints at hand](https://www.heltweg.org/posts/who-wrote-this-shit/).

## Resources

One way to develop a sense of coding style is to read a lot of code, but where to learn about coding style explicitly?

### Specific R resources

The most popular, or at least most documented style guide out there is the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).

Some variations on it include

-   [Mark Padgham's spacing preferences](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/CONTRIBUTING.html#development-guidelines);
-   [Roger Peng's 8-space indentations](https://simplystatistics.org/posts/2018-07-27-why-i-indent-my-code-8-spaces/);
-   Yihui Xie's preference for equal sign assignments (cf e.g. [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/R/highlight.R));
-   Your own preferences? Feel free to mention them in the comments. This is a non-judgmental space (or indent :grin:).

Another excellent resource is [Jenny Bryan's useR! 2018 keynote *"Code Smells and Feels"*](https://github.com/jennybc/code-smells-and-feels).
It's more focused on code structure and commenting.

### General resources

The resources listed below are books without a free version online.
Hopefully libraries and used book stores can help.

`r hugodown::embed_tweet("951152160435310592")`

-   [The Art of Readable Code by Dustin Boswell, Trevor Foucher](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8677004-the-art-of-readable-code) can be (even for those who do not view it as a beach read :cocktail:), a short, light and actionable read.

-   [Refactoring by Martin Fowler](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44936.Refactoring) is an inspiration for the aforementioned keynote talk by Jenny Bryan.
    It defines code smells and refactoring techniques.
    See also the blogpost ["Explaining Variable" by Pete Hodgson](https://blog.thepete.net/blog/2021/06/24/explaining-variable/) (heard of via [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/1412140590842597385)).

-   [The Programmer's Brain by Felienne Hermans](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57196550-the-programmer-s-brain) gives a perspective on e.g. how code smells or bad naming influence cognitive load.
    It is full of practical tips.

### A special note on Markdown styling

A bit meta and less R specific but when writing this post in Markdown we hit return after each sentence or even more regularly.
This does not influence how the resulting post looks like but it makes reviewing easier as GitHub PR comments and change suggestions are by line!
See more [rationale about this](https://cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/#line-wrapping).

## Tools

-   In RStudio selecting code and hitting `Ctrl + I` will re-indent code for you!

-   The [lintr R package by Jim Hester](https://github.com/r-lib/lintr) has a lot of useful linters such as whether code is commented, whether lines are too long etc.

-   The [styler R package](https://styler.r-lib.org) automatically reformats code.
    Its documentation includes a handy vignette on [customizing styler](https://styler.r-lib.org/articles/customizing_styler.html), for when preferences differ from the default.
    An example of application is the [tiny spaceout R package](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/spaceout) that adds spaces between code references.

-   One of the aspects checked by rOpenSci Mark Padgham's [pkgcheck package](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/index.html) is *"Left-assign operators must be used consistently throughout all code (so either all = or all \<-, but not a mixture of both)."*.

For more tools helping with code improvements, refer to the [R-hub blog post "Workflow automation tools for package developers"](/2020/04/29/maintenance/) including tips on *when* to use such tools.

## Etiquette

If you are a contributor to a codebase, you'll probably have to adapt your style to the maintainer's or maintainers' preferences.
These preferences might be implicit (seen by reading existing code) or explicit (in a contributing guide).
Now, depending on your relation to the maintainers (e.g. is it your first contribution), you might start a discussion about changing some of the conventions, perhaps changing their mind or reaching a compromise (assigning with `=`, but with spaces before and after each equal sign).

If you are the maintainer of a codebase, you'll need to be forgiving when stating your preferences and explaining how to implement them; or you might even want to take matters in your own hands and do some [restyling yourself](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/pull/432#pullrequestreview-368391904).

## Conclusion

In this post we shared documentation of and tooling for coding style.
We hope it can help you write or advocate for more readable code.
Practice makes perfect, so go forth and participate in code production and reviews.
