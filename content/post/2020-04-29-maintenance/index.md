As a package developer, there are a few things you need to stay on top on.
Following bug reports and feature requests of course, but also regularly testing your package, ensuring the docs are up-to-date and typo-free...
Some of these things you might do without even pausing to think, whereas for others you might need more reminders.
In this blog post, we shall explore a few tools making your workflow potentially smoother.

## What tools

Already covered elsewhere by yours truly.

## Where to use the tools

Locally vs. on the cloud?
Example of GitHub Actions workflows for PRs.

## When to use the tools?

Remember?
R CMD check, coverage: CI! Link to Julia's post. https://juliasilge.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-travis/

> "The idea behind continuous integration is that CI will automatically run R CMD check (along with your tests, etc.) every time you push a commit to GitHub. You don't have to remember to do this; CI automatically checks the code after every commit."
Julia Silge

Link to other CI references (latest usethis release post, Jim's slide comparing CI, tic's docs)

The life-hack above by Julia Silge, "LIFE HACK: My go-to strategy for getting Travis builds to work is snooping on *other* people's .travis.yml files.", applies to other CI providers too!

precommit, usethis pre-commit hook for the README (skipped by GitHub when edited from the interface)
Regularly scheduled jobs, e.g. URL checking in R-hub docs.
usethis' release issue template.

## Less automatic aspects of package maintenance

Following your own bug tracker (for bug reports but also feature requests). 
Notification settings?
React or work by period?

Following development upstream (R, packages). 
What channels?

Following developer convos to update and improve your practices.
Nice people refactoring your code? https://github.com/ropensci/codemetar/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ahsonne https://github.com/ropensci/codemetar/issues/222#issuecomment-448672148 https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code
R-pkg-devel &friends, other news channel, this blog. :wink:
