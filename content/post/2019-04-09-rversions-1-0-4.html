<p>Version 1.0.4 of the <code>rversions</code> package has been released on CRAN! <code>rversions</code> queries the main R SVN repository to find the versions r-release and r-oldrel refer to, and also all previous R versions and their release dates.</p>
<p>Get <code>rversions</code>’s latest version from
a <a href="https://rud.is/b/2019/03/03/cran-mirror-security/">safe</a> CRAN mirror near
you:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;rversions&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This release, compared to <code>rversions</code> 1.0.3, brings :sparkles: caching :sparkles: of the R versions within each R session (less useless queries!) thanks to a contribution by <a href="https://github.com/richfitz">Rich FitzJohn</a>; a documentation website built with <code>pkgdown</code>; and a new home for <code>rversions</code>’ source from METACRAN to R-hub! :house: Not too much, but since it’s the first time we blog about <code>rversions</code>, we’ll use the release as an opportunity to introduce it with all due respect! How does <code>rversions</code> work and what is it useful for?</p>

<h1>Where does <code>rversions</code> get its information from?</h1>
<p>As you might have guessed, R is developed under version control. The R Core team uses SVN, i.e.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion">Apache Subversion</a>. The versions <code>rversions</code> guesses are derived from SVN <em>tags</em> in the <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R/">main R SVN repository</a>. In SVN lingo, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion#Branching_and_tagging">“tagging refers to labeling the repository at a certain point in time so that it can be easily found in the future.”</a> so it might remind you of GitHub releases. In more details,</p>

<li>r-release is the latest SVN tag</li>
<li>r-oldrel is the latest of the previous minor version</li>
<li>r-release-tarball is the latest SVN tag that has a corresponding tar.gz to download</li>
<li>Windows, macOS are the same: latest SVN tag that has a file to download</li>
